## COVID-19_SIR_Project

1.	Designed an SIR (Susceptible Infected Recovery) Algorithm Program to simulate the covid-19 pandemic using a normal probability distribution for infection initiation. 

2.	The algorithms is designed to work on 2-Dimensional Graph Structure which used each point as a person which is randomly connected to several other points (people in real    life).

3.	The infection is spread by initiating in some people in the graph of points using a Gaussian distribution .

4.	The process of spread of infection and recovery then starts in a cycle.
